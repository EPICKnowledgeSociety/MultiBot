# MultiBot
C# Program to control RosBot party using Enigma API and TCP Communication

Known issues: put ramaladnis on a last tab with good room, cause they dont stack

You need to setup correct Port Forwarding for the server, since it is a TCP Server.
Also dont forget to put a exception on Windows Firewall or disable it.

Only works with 2 players until some details are sorted out

Be sure to try to connect with Client after the Server has started and is ready.
